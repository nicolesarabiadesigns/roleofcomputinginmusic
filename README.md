# Origin-of-Creative-Computing-in-Music
Creative computing has become prolific to the modern day music industry. One of it's most dominant sub-groups includes Algorithmic Composition (a.k.a. Musical Metacreation). This technique has some conflicting definitions between the eras, as either : _"the process of using some formal process to make music with minimal human intervention"_ (Alpern, 1995) or _"endowing machines with the ability to achieve creative musical tasks, such as composition, interpretation, improvisation, accompaniment, mixing, etc. It covers all dimensions of the theory and practice of computational generative music systems, ranging from purely artistic approaches to purely scientific ones, inclusive of discourses relevant to this topic from the humanities"_ (Philippe Pasquier, 2017). Whilst it's presence has become more obvious over the past century, it's origins trace back far longer than expected.

One of the earliest accounts of optimising the creation of music dates back to the Ancient Greeks. Pythagoras is thought to show a relation between nature and harmony of sounds in music. 

_"The word music had a much wider meaning to the Greeks than it has to us. In the teachings of Pythagoras and his followers, music was inseperable from numbers, which were thought to be the key to the whole spiritual and physical universe. So the system of musical sounds and rhythms, being ordered by numbers exemplified the harmony of the cosmos and corresponded to it" (Grout, 1996)._

This mathematical process emphasised the importance of intervals and modes, but it did not conjure music automatically- human involvement in the form of decision making was still essential to create music.

One of the accountable shifts towards using an alogrithm in music was Mozart's "Dice Music" created in 1792. He created a music game that used a dice to randomly bring small fragments of music together. This in turn generated an alogorithm, leaving the choice of composition to be determined by the roll of a dice. Here we see how a game removed some of creative responsibility from the human creator and transfered it to the algorithm of the game.

The three dominant approaches in the early days of CC included Artificial Intelligence (AI), rule-based and stochastic. 

**Artifical Intelligence** can be used in music generation by "(i) nonadaptive methods that rely on user modeling for generating interesting and meaningful music, (ii) probabilistic approaches that learn, either implicitly or explicitly, from data, and (iii) evolutionary methods that allow intuitive user interaction" (Maximos Kaliakatsos-Papakostas, Andreas Floros, Michael N. Vrahatis, Artificial intelligence methods for music generation: a review and future perspectives,
2020)

**Rule- based** creative computing was pioneered by Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson at the University of Illinois (1955-56). Hiller and Isaacson experimented with the Illiac Suite program and in turn transformed raw musical material and modified it to create rule-based results. This process is now known as the _"generator/modifier/selector"_ paradigm. 

One of the most identifiable forms of **stochastic** music is through the use of the Markov Chain. It is an overview of a sequence of events (in this case notes) and the probability of the notes that follow based on previous notes. The rule can be followed as follows: 
1.) Take corpus of chords
2.) Calculate probability distribution for chords to follow a particular chord
3.) Define the first chord or make a random choice
4.) Make a random choice of the next chord taking into an account probability distribution
5.) Repeat step 4.

I'm personally very intruiged by the involvement of creative computing in music whether that be in the creation of music or it's use to enhance music. I was first drawn to research this because of a lecture with Joel Gethin-Lewis on Computational thinking. He highlighted one of the roles computing played in building atmosphere in a concert setting. This piqued my interest and decided to look into the origins of how computing became involved with the music industry. The results surprised me. Whilst I had a shallow understanding that mathematics may have played a role in the early days, seeing it's evolution and mile-stone developments was very interesting. I hope to learn more about creative computing in the music industry and apply it to future videography or animation work.
